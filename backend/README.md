The backend folder contains the code for the backend. It consists of code for two different systems; Helium and Firease.

Helium:
The folder contains the decoder used to decode the mac addresses, so they have the right format for the HTTP integration.

Firebase:
The firebase folder contains the main.py file, which was deployed to Firebase functions. This is responsible for making sure the backend handles data appropriately, calling third party API's, handling errors and updating the database etc.


Both Files include descriptions and commenting.
